# Fe55
# Fe55 x-ray exposures are acquired in sets of a given exposure time and 
# image count. Bias images are acquired prior to acquiring any fe55 images.
# The number of bias frames is set by FE55_BCOUNT
# For each command, dark images of the appropriate integration time are 
# also acquired. The number of dark frames is set by FE55_DCOUNT.

# Dark
# Dark integration images are acquired in sets of a given exposure time and 
# image count. Bias images are acquired prior to acquiring any dark images
# 
# A constant named DARK_BCOUNT is used to specifiy the number of bias images
# to acquire as part of the data set prior to acquiring the dark images.

# superflat
# 'superflat' images are sets of identical flat field exposures that can
# be medianed together to produce a flat field image with reduced variation
# due to poisson statistics. They are useful in calculating CTE and PRNU and
# for finding dark defects.

# to acquire as part of the data set prior to acquiring the flat field images.

#0) Pause for ten minutes with no light on the sensor, then do a clear of the array (or equivalently take a bias frame)
#1) Take a set of five rapid-sequence bias frames, i.e. 0 sec exposures, with no clears in between. This will be our baseline.
#2) Take a set of three 20 sec long dark frames, with no clears in between. This measures the light leakage in the system.
#1) take a single flat-field image at beyond saturation flux levels. This will lead to spill-over in the parallel but not serial overscan, I expect. An image taken at 4x the exposure time needed to get to one half of spill-over full well would be fine. Broadband white light would be good.
#2) Then take a succession of dark frames with the following exposure times:
#0 seconds
#0 seconds
#0 seconds
#5 seconds
#5 seconds
#5 seconds
#10 seconds
#10 seconds
#20 seconds
